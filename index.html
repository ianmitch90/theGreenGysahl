<!-- HolyMoly!!!!! look at all these meta tags and links!!!!!! 🌪
    this is a little bit much right? here are a few things we are trying to acomplish with these
    lets take it section by section:

    1) your standard meta tags Charset/Viewport/Compatibility check for IE=Edge browsers
    
    2) twitter! every tag is pretty self descriptive however we use this as a preview card
    everytime twitter will try and make a neat preview card for us to make it appealing to visit!
    
    3) Open Graph: so remember how we gave twitter images and info to make a preview for us? well
    well the opengraph protocol allows us to make a generalized card, and allow the service using
    our link to have the information to make a preview card!
    heres a great article on why all of this is important!
    https://neilpatel.com/blog/open-graph-meta-tags/
    
    4) preloading: so generally this is not useful here since our assets are shipped with our html
    this is not providing us with a lot of performance gains. HOWEVER lets say you had a
    remote font/css/images/videos/etc that is on another server? this lets the browser know that
    whatever you are preloading has HIGH PRIORITY, usually these are critical assets that you dont
    want to show up after the page is built. we can avoid problems with connection issues/file size/etc
    
    5) Favicons: i love favicons!!! these are the images that show up on your tab/bookmarks/app icons/etc
    it allows your site to have some flavor when someone is saving it or viewing it. usually a logo
    or some image relevant to your site would go here. take note of the diffrent versions and sizes
    are saved in the /favicon folder! for now try and use a favicon generator and then customize what
    you want until you are able to make your own from scratch 

    **overview of social media META TAGS**
    https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/
    remember: you can also get analytics of traffic and general information if you are ever intrested
    using even more meta tags! get comfortable using them!

    FINNNNALLLLY SOMETHING IM USED TO: 💦
    finishing up with the head tag, we have our website Title/Google Fonts/Styles.css
        **Important stuff to pay attn to!
            but didn't you preload this already? sure! i did! however that was for the browser to go
            out before it builds the page! i never told it to USE anything! please visit the 
            HTML preload specification online!!! and like i said before it's not useful for this
            project but, it's good to know what EXACTLY it does for you!

<!-- Lets Get Started!!!!! ⚡️

        So! you know allll the things dealing with what SHOWS UP ON THE PAGE!
        ok so i like to designate a header/main/footer and then use mostly divs for other things
        why? well for accesibility reasons since im adding aria tags it's a bit over kill to use all
        the HTML tags ONTOP of ARIA attr.

        Objectives this Page:
            -Simple ARIA
            -Themeing/Setting a Design pattern
            -Contrast and Readability (see styles.css )
            -Mobile First Way of Thinking

     ⭕️ IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT ARIA SCREEN READERS!
        *** NO ARIA IS BETTER THAN BAD ARIA *** 
    
            wait, what? are you going to show us the proper way to do it? NOPE! this is going
            to get you started intergrating ARIA slowly!!! REMEMBER! there is NO VISUAL COMPONENT!!
            A good way to think about how your site's USER EXPERIENCE is going from VIDEO PODCAST to
            a AUDIO ONLY PODCAST! meaning, add as much relevant description! explain when you can
            and be concise but, it's like totally but kind of, but honestly don't ramble...... 
            oh no! i already messed up! 💦 
    
        Your ALT-er EGO!!!!! anything requires you to see just go ahead and throw an alt attr on it!
        it's just generally good practice EVEN IF THE ALT IS EMPTY always put it on
        helps screen reading defaults but also if something should fail lets say an image or video
        doesn't load properly the user can easily figure out was was SUPPOSED TO BE THERE and that
        something went wrong and they usually might refresh the page.

    Flexbox and Flex Grid! thats all CSS stuff! but i'll get into that in depth in the Explore page

    to see how this page looks WITHOUT styles just copy line 76 and then delete and refresh your browser
